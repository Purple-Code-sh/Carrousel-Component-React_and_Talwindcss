# Carrousel Component for React-Talwindcss
## Things you need to know before using:
* Have TailwindCss on your react project.
* Read all the comments on the file.

* You need to install an icon library using: npm install react-icons
* Import your own images or it wont work.
* The images array can be modified at your convenience.
* When you go to use it (into another file, *import*) put it in a **div** and give a ***height and width*** to that div. This is important because the component has characteristics to adjust its size to his father size.
